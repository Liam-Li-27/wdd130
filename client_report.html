                    I carefully selected the content and imagery to align with my brand identity and target audience, focusing on clarity, visual appeal, and user experience. Communication with the development team was generally smooth, with a few minor challenges that were addressed promptly through clear feedback and regular check-ins. The final result met my expectations in both design and functionality. In the future, I plan to provide a more comprehensive project brief and clearer timelines to ensure an even more efficient and streamlined collaboration.

                    I managed the development team by breaking down tasks into clear, actionable items using tools like Trello and GitHub Projects, assigning them based on each junior developer’s strengths and experience. Communication with the client was maintained through regular check-ins via email and video meetings to ensure alignment at every stage; while there were occasional delays in feedback, we resolved them through proactive follow-ups. When the site was ready, we handled deployment smoothly—setting up hosting, pushing the final build live, and sharing access and documentation with the client for easy handoff. Using GitHub for version control was essential; it helped us track progress, manage collaboration, and quickly resolve any bugs or merge conflicts throughout development.

                I communicated with my team lead primarily through Slack and project management tools like Trello or GitHub Issues. Communication was generally clear, though I occasionally had to ask for clarification on specific tasks. For each site, I was given clear expectations and knew what was required of me, which helped me stay on track. I was able to contribute meaningfully to the sites by handling components, styling, and small bug fixes. There were a few minor issues with GitHub, especially around merge conflicts and pushing changes, but with guidance from the team, I was able to resolve them and improve my workflow.

                    <li>I think the most challenging part of this project for me is that I need to communicate with people in my team and analyses the code written by different people. </li>
                    <li>I enjoy that I can do many projects together, it makes me feel so good. Especially when I play the role as the leader developer, I can do the most challenging part of the job and lead people. I love the feeling of dominating and leading people. It feels so good.</li>
                    <li>I will learn some advance and pretty layout from some other website. Then, I will fuse all those code that match to my website together.</li>
                    <li>Yes, I feel really good, because I can demand all the requirement of my client that means that I could even work in a website company right now. I can make money right now!</li>
